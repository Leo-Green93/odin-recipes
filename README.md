# odin-recipes
This is my solution to The Odin Project's intro course recipes project.
This project demonstrates basic HTML skills including setting up a boilerplate, using header and paragraph tags, links and images, and both ordered and unordered lists.
This project is also my first use of Git, including add and commit cycles, in order to push code up to GitHub.
