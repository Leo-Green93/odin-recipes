    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic, quick bread uses baking soda and buttermilk instead of yeast to achieve its rise. Its inexpensive and easy-to-find ingredients make this recipe doable even on a tight budget.</p>
    <p>When you bake this warm, crumbly loaf, you'll have trouble leaving some for later!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup margarine, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>4 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, melted (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup buttermilk (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Farenheit and lightly grease a large baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Mix the flour, margarine, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in one cup of buttermilk and egg.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead slightly. Form dough into a round and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Optionally, combine 1/4th cup of melted butter and 1/4th cup of buttermilk in a small bowl, then brush over the surface of the loaf. Cut an 'X' into the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for about 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Serve with butter and jelly or other toppings as desired.</li>
    </ol>
